#PostManager is a module for handling Posts.  It directly interfaces
# with the Post module and instances Posts
# It does:
#    -instantiate posts
#    -Pickle Posts
#    -Place pk files in db
#    -Manage Posts

# use post_instance.stat() to get a dump of a posts's 
#contents for db write.
# Purposely made the stat method a Python DataStruc in order to make it
# compatible with any db.

no built in methods for retrieving any saved state whether from a 
session or a pickle.
